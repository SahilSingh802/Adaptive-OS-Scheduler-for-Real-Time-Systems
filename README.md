Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems
This project implements an adaptive scheduling system for real-time operating systems. The scheduler dynamically adjusts task priorities based on deadlines and system load, ensuring high CPU utilization and minimal deadline misses.

Key Features:
Task Management System – Stores tasks with execution time, priority, and deadline.

Adaptive Scheduling – Implements Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS).

Real-Time Priority Adjustment – Dynamically modifies priorities based on system workload.

Preemptive Scheduling – Ensures real-time execution with minimal delay.

Performance Analysis & Visualization – Generates Gantt charts and evaluates CPU efficiency.

Technologies Used:
C++ (Core scheduler implementation)

Python (Matplotlib, Tkinter) (For visualization)

Priority Queues & Multithreading (Efficient task handling)

GitHub & Docker (For collaboration and deployment)

Project Roadmap:
Implement task queue & priority-based scheduling.

Develop EDF & RMS scheduling algorithms.

Introduce dynamic priority adjustments.

Add CPU performance analysis and visualization.

Optimize & finalize the scheduler.
